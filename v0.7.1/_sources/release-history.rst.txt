Version 0.7.1 (2021-01-29)
--------------------------
USGS software release associated with `Groundwater` publication

Version 0.7.0 (2021-01-15)
--------------------------
* major speed-up (and overhead reduction) to finding routing paths (by replacing recursion strategy with simple for loop)
* in preprocessing module, use 1st percentile elevations sampled from DEM to avoid outliers (bad pixels)
* in preprocessing module, add option to re-use output from zonal statistics
* bug fix: refactor calls to gisutils.df2shp to use crs instead of epsg, etc.

Version 0.6.2 (2020-11-12)
--------------------------
* write unconnected reaches to connectiondata, as required by MODFLOW-6 v6.2

Version 0.6.1 (2020-11-04)
--------------------------
* deprecate sfrmaker.gis.CRS class in favor of :class:`pyproj.crs.CRS`
* add :func:`sfrmaker.routing.get_previous_ids_in_subset` function that can find outlet locations if the specified line IDs for outlets aren't in a consolidated (one_reach_per_cell=True) sfr network
* some bug fixes to the ``add_outlets`` option
* some fixes to the input data for the MERAS example

Version 0.6.0 (2020-10-15)
--------------------------
* ``add_outlets`` argument to :meth:`sfrmaker.lines.Lines.to_sfr` to add outlet conditions (outseg=0) at the locations of specified line IDs
* add :mod:`sfrmaker.preprocesing` module for culling NHDPlus flowlines, handling divergences, incorporating widths from the North American River Width (NARWidth) database, and reproducible editing of flowlines.
* fix :func:`sfrmaker.utils.width_from_arbolate_sum`: minimum width wasn't being implemented
* small fix to observations module to treat observation names as strings, even if they are digits
* small fix to `meth`:`sfrmaker.sfrdata.SFRData.write_package` if no options are supplied, set default fileout and obs6 entries to same location as SFR package file (by just writing the file names; previously, the full path to the SFR package file was written)

Version 0.5.0 (2020-08-10)
--------------------------
* added from_yaml method to construct an SFR package from a configuration file
* deprecated use of the Flopy SpatialReference object
* add option to write MF6 packagedata block to an external file
* add default writing of source hydrography line_ids to MF6 packagedata as an auxiliary variable
* use pyproj CRS module internally for more robust handling of coordinate reference systems
* add starting gage package unit number attribute to SFRData that can be set by the user

Version 0.4.0 (2020-4-25)
--------------------------
* add automated setup (``SFRdata.add_observations`` method) of sfr observation locations (gages for mf2005 or obs input for mf6), from (x, y) locations, line_ids in source hydrography, or at specified reach numbers
* some minor patches to the gis module to use the new CRS module in pyproj to parse epsg codes and length units
* added screening of inactive cellids (set gw cellid to None) in MODFLOW6 flopy SFR package instance creation
* added support for MODFLOW-2005 gage package setup
* added support for specified inflows in MODFLOW-2005 (add_to_segment_data method)
* added to_riv method to convert SFR segments to RIV package; DataPackage base class

Version 0.3.0 (2020-2-12)
--------------------------
* replace FloPy SpatialReference with support for FloPy modelgrid
* updated modflow-6 execs to v 6.1
* minor big fixes/improvements to get_upsegs function in routing module

Version 0.2.1 (2019-12-12)
--------------------------
* fixed bug that was causing cases with only one (intersected stream) segment to fail

Version 0.2.0 (2019-12-08)
--------------------------
* added support for MODFLOW6 observation setup
* added support for specified inflows in MODFLOW6
* added get_inflow_locations_from_parent_model to get specified stream inflow values from a parent model
* bug fixes related to MODFLOW6 support

Version 0.1 Initial release (2019-07-12)
----------------------------------------
* see prior GitHub commits for "prehistory" of the project dating back to ArcPy scripts in 2013
